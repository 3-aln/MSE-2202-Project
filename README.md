# MSE 2202 Final Project - Code Repository
## Lab 004 Team 2
Members:
- Allen Sun
- Benjamin Seeley
- Dongjun Kim
- Soroush Kafaee

The repository is structured as follows:
- Main branch:
  - `Libraries` folder: contains the NewPing Arduino library used during testing of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor module.
  - `Main Code/MSEbot_basecode` folder: contains the final version of the bot's code, common to all members.
  - `Milestone 2/MSEbot_basecode` folder: contains the version of the code used in demonstrating the bot's climbing ability for Milestone 2. It was used as a starting point for the final code.
  - `Testing` folder: contains various files used in testing various components related to the bot, such as the MSE 2201 DC motor, ultrasonic sensor, and L298N motor driver. Also contains intermediate files used for testing of the robot's motion leading up to the final version of the main code. 
- The other branches contain the variations of the code corresponding to each team member. In each case, only minor variable changes were implemented to tune the bot's motion for each member's unique conditions.
