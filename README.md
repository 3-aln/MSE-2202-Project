# MSE-2202-Project

## Setting up Git and cloning this repository

1. Follow the steps in this link to install Git: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git
2. Open Git Bash and navigate to the folder you'd like to add your copy of this repository into by typing `cd [path]` then pressing Enter. Or, you can just right-click within the desired folder in Windows Explorer and click 'Git Bash Here'. Not sure if the latter works for Mac.
3. In Git Bash, enter `git clone [repository]`, replacing `[repository]` with the HTTPS link you get after pressing the green "Code" button above.
4. A new folder has been created called "MSE-2202-Project". Navigate into this folder in Git Bash by entering `cd MSE-2202-Project`.
6. From here, you're good to start making changes and committing/pushing to the repository.
7. To exit Git Bash, type `exit`.
